A directory structure and metadata linter based on JSON Schema.

[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) is great for validating (files containing) JSON
objects that e.g. contain metadata, but these are only the smallest pieces in the
organization of a whole directory structure, e.g. of some dataset of project.
When working on datasets of a certain kind, they might contain various types of data,
each different file requiring different accompanying metadata, based on its file type
and/or location.

**DirSchema** combines JSON Schemas and regexes into a solution to enforce structural
dependencies and metadata requirements in directories and directory-like archives.
With it you can for example check that:

* only files of a certain type are in a location (e.g. only `jpg` files in directory `img`)
* for each data file there exists a metadata file (e.g. `test.jpg` has `test.jpg_meta.json`)
* each metadata file is valid according to some JSON Schema

If validating these kinds of constraints looks appealing to you, this tool is for you!

## Installation and Usage

Install the tool using `pip install` just as any other Python package.

Read the [manual](./MANUAL.md) to learn how to write a dirschema.

Given a DirSchema file and a directory that needs to be checked, just run:
```
dirschema my_dirschema.yaml some/directory
```
If there is no output, everything is fine. Otherwise, the tool will return for each
checked file the violated rules.

You can call the validation from Python using the class `DSValidator` in
`dirschema.validator`, e.g. `DSValidator("/path/to/dirschema").validate("/dataset/path")`

## Development

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.

Clone this repository and run `poetry install`.

Run `pre-commit install` after cloning to enable pre-commit to enforce the required linting hooks.

Run `pytest` before merging your changes to make sure you did not break anything.

To generate documentation, run `pdoc --html -o docs python_app_template`.

To check coverage, use `pytest --cov`.

To run the tests with different Python versions, run `tox`.
You can use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
to manage and install other Python interpreter versions without touching the system.
You should install the versions in the `.python-version` file.
